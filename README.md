# Flask Task Manager

A full-stack task management application built with **Flask**, **React**, and **PostgreSQL**.

This project was developed from scratch as a learning project focused on modern web development practices. It evolved over multiple development sessions from a simple Flask application into a production-ready full-stack application featuring authentication, REST APIs, database persistence, cloud deployment, and a React frontend.

# Local Installation

Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOstephenaevans87/task-manager.git
```

Enter the project:

```bash
cd task-manager
```

Create a virtual environment:

```bash
python -m venv venv
```

Activate it:

Linux/macOS

```bash
source venv/bin/activate
```

Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Install frontend dependencies:

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
```

---

# Running the Application

## Terminal 1 — Flask Backend

```bash
cd ~/task-manager
source venv/bin/activate
python app.py
```

The Flask API runs at:

```
http://127.0.0.1:5000
```

---

## Terminal 2 — React Frontend

```bash
cd ~/task-manager/frontend
npm run dev
```

Open the Vite URL displayed in the terminal (typically):

```
http://localhost:5173
```

---

# Database Migrations

Create a migration:

```bash
flask db migrate -m "Description"
```

Apply migrations:

```bash
flask db upgrade
```

---

# Production Deployment

The application is deployed on **Render**.

Deployment is fully automated through GitHub.

Every push to the main branch automatically triggers a new deployment.

Production start command:

```bash
flask db upgrade && gunicorn app:app
```

## Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the project root.

Example:

```text
FLASK_ENV=development
SECRET_KEY=your-random-secret-key
DATABASE_URL=sqlite:///tasks.db
```

For production (Render), configure these variables in the Render dashboard rather than committing them to Git.

# Future Improvements

Possible future enhancements include:

- Email reminders
- Push notifications
- Background task scheduling
- Docker support
- Automated testing
- OAuth authentication
- Calendar integration
- Mobile application
